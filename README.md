## What is this?
Storyblocks is a story told by everyone, one word at a time, on the blockchain. In the game:
- the price to mint a new word in the story goes up linearly over time
- every word holder is paid royalties from every word minted after them
	- this incentivizes people to choose words that continue the story
- words can be changed every two days
	- so, for example, you can sell your word to someone else and they can change it

This means that we can all tell a story together. And the story will change over time as people change their words.

- OpenSea NFT docs used to structure contract
- words verified to be in set of allowed words through merkle proof
- set of allowed words is a small subset (~2000) of the most common English words
